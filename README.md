# Guru99-Banking-app

I have successfully completed both unit testing and system testing for this project. All critical functionalities have been thoroughly validated with comprehensive test cases covering positive, negative, and edge scenarios. The unit tests ensure that each module performs as expected in isolation, while the system tests confirm that the integrated application meets functional, and error-handling requirements under real-world conditions.
